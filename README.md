This README describes practical examples of production-quality Python-language code which
exhibit the security and scalability features needed in a (hostile) production environment where debugging needs to occur quickly.

Programs here make use of uv (from astral.sh) instead of pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, etc. 
To catch dependency issues, we recommend that the latest set of dependencies is assembled daily by 
creating <tt>requirements.txt</tt>, <tt>pyprojects.toml</tt>, and <tt>uv.lock</tt> with every run.

We also recommend that libraries download historical versions of each library downloaded so that in case of issues, forensics and fall-back can be performed even though public versions become corrupted.

## Featured Projects

Code which we think have the most <strong>practical usefulness</strong>:

* <a href="./dundars-list.py">dundars-list.py</a> lists programs by date, along with the <tt>__last_change__</tt> and <tt>__status__</tt> text in each python program.

capture timings and costs for each request. Here is a sample table for recognizing the word "docker":

<a name="CodingPractices"></a>

## Coding Practices

Below are notes about coding practices, from the top down:

1.  At the very top of the file:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```
    That enables you to run the program as a script without typing python3:
    ```bash
    ./mondrian-gen.py
    ```
    instead of 
    ```bash
    python3 mondrian-gen.py
    ```

1.  This specifies that emjois and non-English characters (such as Japanese, Chinese, etc.) may be in the code file:
    ```python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    ```

1.  SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) license identifiers provide machine-readable tags to communicate the license governing a piece of software. 
    ```python
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0
    ```
    The MPL-2.0 (Mozilla Public License version 2.0) is a moderately permissive open-source license with some copyleft provisions. Its key characteristics include:
    * Allows code to be freely used, modified, and shared
    * Requires modifications to MPL-licensed files to be shared under the same license
    * Allows MPL-licensed code to be combined with code under different licenses
    * Provides patent protection for contributors and users
    * Requires preservation of copyright notices

1.  Dunder (double underscore) variables in the module define metadata about the program. PEP specifies that such variables can be read by other programs without opening the source code.
    ```python
    __commit_date__ = "2025-05-20"
    __version__ = "1.0.0"
    __author__ = "Your Name"
    __license__ = "MIT"
    __commit_date__ = "2025-05-20"
    __status__ = "Production"
    __doc__ = "This module demonstrates the use of dunder (double underscore) variables in Python."
    ```
    # TODO: Some also have like <tt>__commit_hash__ = "a1b2c3d4e5f6"</tt>
    # But How to get the commit hash? Doesn't adding it change the hash value?

1.  To capture the program start time at the earliest moment, the built-in time module is used:
    ```python
    import time
    std_strt_timestamp = time.monotonic()
    ```
    <tt>time.monotonic()</tt> returns the time since an arbitrary point in the past, which is not affected by system clock changes.

1.  External dependencies are specified in a requirements.txt file.
    ```python
    import requests
    ```

1.  Within the requirements.txt file, the <strong>myutils</strong> module is loaded to provide all other custom Python programs in this repo:
   ```python
   import myutils
   ```

1.  Modules used The ast (Abstract Syntax Tree) module parses Python source code into a structure so code can be better analyzed or modified programmatically.
   ```python
   import ast
   ```
   ast is used by linters, type checkers, and other such tools to analyze code without running it.

1.  All functions defined in this file are prefixed with myutil_ to avoid name conflicts in other modules.
    ```python
    def myutil_print(msg):
        print(msg)
    ```

1.  The function issuing a message to the console is printed along with the message:
    ```python
    def myutil_print(msg):
        print(msg)
    ```



## Ones I would like to create

* Reset all my passwords automatically. This would involve my database in KeePassXC and 1Password, then programmatic control operating Authy and emails to confirm.

* Functions to reference a physical Yubikey containing secrets and cryptographic certificates.


The STATUS of each program is noted within each file.

Before running each:
```
chmod +x dijkstras.py
./dijkstras.py
```
