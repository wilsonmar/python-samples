# PROTIP: solved by setting your IDE to automatically remove
# W391 blank line at end of file
# W293 blank line contains whitespace
# 1. Open VS Code settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
# 2. Search for "trim trailing whitespace"
# 3. Check the box for "Files: Trim Trailing Whitespace" Or add this in VSCode's settings.json:
#    json{
#       "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true
#    }
